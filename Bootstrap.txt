offset-1 :to shift the col with one space


justify-content-center : we use it in the row to center col horizontally 

align-self-center : we use it with col to center writings vertically 

align-items-center: added to row to center the row vertically
    
order-sm-last and first : to order the content 

when you change the color in class navbar-dark you should remove bg-color from html

btn-block


tooltips:need script jquery tag

Modal : you should place the content on the top of the page (under the nav )
we are using id so that the modal can be triggered from the navbar
class: modal , fade(to fade into the screen) 
role:dialog to be displayed on the top

you can use the modal when you want to hover on an image and get's bigger
or to host a form (login form)

we use a span with class navbar-text in the navbar after the ul 
to include a link in the navbar and show it as text

we use attribute data-toggle to include javasript

His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>
